## Current Projects

<p><samp>Currently, I'm working on two Project, one is my bachelor's thesis which is called <a alt="Foppa" href="https://github.com/MunsMan/Foppa">Foppa</a> and is a asynchronous microservices-based runtime system for serverless functions in federated FaaS.
At the moment it is developed inside AWS Lambda, but I'm planning to build a local Docker deployment as well.
The second Project is a <a alt="clean docs" href="https://github.com/MunsMan/clean_docs">PDF Viewer</a>, which fits better in my personal development workflow.
This mean file-watching for latex, keyboard controls like vim and easy customizable via a single config file.</samp></p>

<samp>If a project sounds interesting, just take a look.</samp>

<p><samp>Like many developers I started tuning my developing setup to my personal liking.  
Currently, I have two public repos containing my entire setup.
First we have my <a alt="dot files" href="https://github.com/MunsMan/dotfiles">dot files</a> where you can find my TMUX and NeoVim config and much more.
The second is just my personal <a alt="keybaord config" href="ttps://github.com/MunsMan/zmk-config">Keyboard Config</a>, which have Colmark-DH as a base.
My daily driving Keyboard is a <a alt="corne chocolate" href="https://github.com/foostan/crkbd">Corne Chocolate</a>.</samp></p>
