## Current Projects

Currently, I'm working on two Project, one is my bachelor's thesis which is called [Foppa](https://github.com/MunsMan/Foppa) and is a asynchronous microservices-based runtime system for serverless functions in federated FaaS.
At the moment it is developed inside AWS Lambda, but I'm planning to build a local Docker deployment as well.
The second Project is a [PDF Viewer](https://github.com/MunsMan/clean_docs), which fits better in my personal development workflow.
This mean file-watching for latex, keyboard controls like vim and easy customizable via a single config file.

If a project sounds interesting, just take a look.

## Developent Setup

![Neovim](https://img.shields.io/badge/NeoVim-%2357A143.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=neovim&logoColor=white)

Like many developers I started tuning my developing setup to my personal liking.  
Currently, I have two public repos containing my entire setup.
First we have my [dot files](https://github.com/MunsMan/dotfiles) where you can find my TMUX and NeoVim config and much more.
The second is just my personal [keyboard config](https://github.com/MunsMan/zmk-config), which have Colmark-DH as a base.
My daily driving Keyboard is a [Corne Chocolate](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd).
